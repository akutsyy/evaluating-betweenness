Brandes Subset/Brandes++:

Testing (From cold start), as-cadia as undirected graph (with a 0 0 edge at the start and no header) - this is as-cadia-zeroed.txt in the evaluation folder.

Copied over as-cadia-zeroed into brandespp/test_input, replaced spaces with tabs. This is as-cadia.txt. Also copied over sources.txt, clusterfile.txt for as-caida and 1000 partitions.

Fixed a bug in Brandes.py line 154

Ran  time python2 Brandes.py test_input/as-caida.txt test_input/sources.txt brandesOutput.txt

Note that it is python2

Output:

Output is in BrandesErdosOutput.txt

Also fixed same bug on line 181 of BrandesPP_log.py

Had to remove 0 0 from as-caida.txt for BrandesPP, but shouldn't affect results. Also removed first line from clusterfile.txt. If sources had chosen 0, I would have to re-run
Also changed cluster 0 to cluster 99 with
sed -i '
