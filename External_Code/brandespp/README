usage:

Brandes.py: python Brandes.py  graphfile sourcefile outputfile
BrandesPP_log.py: python BrandesPP_log.py graphfile sourcefile clusterfile clusterdir
BrandesPP_query.py: python BrandesPP_query.py sourcefile clusterdir numclusters outputfile

explanation:
graphfile: contains edges of graph. Direction or repetition of edges does not matter. format: nodeid1\tnodeid2\n
sourcefile: contains tab separated list of sourcenodes. format: sourceid1\tsourceid2\tsourceid3\t...sourceidn
clusterfile: contains in line i the id of the cluster of node i.  format: clsuterid\n
clusterdir: name of folder where information on supernodes and skeleton is stored. Folder needs to exist before runing code.
numclusters: integer, number of clusters in file. Is allowed to be larger than actual number of clusters.
outputfile: filename, where the centrality of nodes is written
