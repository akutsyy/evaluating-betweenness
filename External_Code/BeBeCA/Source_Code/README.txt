BeBeCA (The source code)

=============================================

This readme file contains information on how to compile and execute
the algorithms available in "BeBeCA/Source_Code/src"

----------------------------------------------
-             The Input Format               -
----------------------------------------------
1- The format of graph inputs for Parallel_Brandes, RAND1, GSIZE, KPATH and EGO:
	First line has the number of nodes and edges, and the remaining lines are edges list,
	each represented by two nodes IDs.
	
	Format:-
	|V| |E|
	Ew Ey
	Ex Ez
	.  .
	.  .
	
	e.g.:-
	4158 13428
	0 1
	0 2
	. .
	. .

2- The format of graph inputs for RAND2, DIAM and ABRA:
	The input file should contain only the edge list without the number of nodes and edges.
	
	Format:-
	Ew Ey
	Ex Ez
	.  .
	.  .
	
	e.g.:-
	0 1
	0 2
	. .
	. .
	
	The following command will remove the first line from the input file:-
	sed 1d graph_input > graph_input_newformat

3- The output format is the same for all implementations:
	Each line will have the node ID along with its betweenness centrality score:-
	
	Format:-
	Vx:			BCx
	Vy:			BCy
	Vz:			BCz
	.    		.
	.    		.
	
	e.g.:-
	0:           23552.792335
	1:           4796.951968
	2:           0.000000


----------------------------------------------
-  How to compile the source code?   -
----------------------------------------------
- Notes before compilation:
	1- In order to compile and run Parallel_Brandes, your machine should support "Open MPI" library
		which could be downloaded from the following link:
		https://www.open-mpi.org/
	2- In order to compile and run ApproxKit, your machine should support "NetworKit" library
		which could be downloaded from the following link:
		https://networkit.iti.kit.edu/

- How to compile? 
	From the current directory (BeBeCA/Source_Code) type the command:-
			$make
	All the source code will be compiled and the following executables
	will be created in the current directory (BeBeCA/Source_Code):
		1- Parallel_Brandes
		2- RAND1
		3- GSIZE
		4- KPATH
		5- EGO
		6- ApproxKit


----------------------------------------------
-  How to run the executable programs?   -
----------------------------------------------
-----------------------
Parallel_Brandes:-
	- How to run? 
		From the executable directory, the following command is used for execution:-
			format: mpirun -np <number_of_processes> ./Parallel_Brandes <number_of_threads> <graph_input_path> <scores_output_path>
			e.g.  : mpirun -np 2 ./Parallel_Brandes 4 ca-GrQc.lcc.net ca-GrQc_Scores.txt
-----------------------
RAND1:-
	- How to run? 
		From the executable directory, the following command is used for execution:-
			format: ./RAND1 <number_of_nodes> <graph_input_path> <scores_output_path>
			e.g.  : ./RAND1 200 ca-GrQc.lcc.net ca-GrQc.lcc_Scores.txt
-----------------------
GSIZE:-
	- How to run? 
		From the executable directory, the following command is used for execution:-
			format: ./GSIZE <node_ID> <c_constant> <graph_input_path> <scores_output_path>
			e.g.  : ./GSIZE 1022 5 ca-GrQc.lcc.net ca-GrQc_Scors.txt
-----------------------
KPATH:-
	- How to run? 
		From the executable directory, the following command is used for execution:-
			format: ./KPATH <number_of_hops> <graph_input_path> <scores_output_path>
			e.g.  : ./KPATH 4 ca-GrQc.lcc.net ca-GrQc_Scores.txt
-----------------------
EGO:-
	- How to run? 
		From the executable directory, the following command is used for execution:-
			format: ./EGO <graph_input_path> <scores_output_path>
			e.g.  : ./EGO ca-GrQc.lcc.net ca-GrQc_Scores.txt
-----------------------
RAND2, DIAM and ABRA:-
	- Notes:
		1- When you run, you should specify which algorithm you want to run:-
			1- Exact betweenness
			2- DIAM
			3- ABRA
			4- RAND2
		2- The format of the input is different. Please refer to the beginning of the READ_ME.txt
	- How to run? 
		To run DIAM or ABRA:
			From the executable directory, the following command is used for execution:-
				format: ./ApproxKit <2_or_3> <graph_input_path> <scores_output_path> <epsilon> <delta>
				e.g.  : ./ApproxKit 2 ca-GrQc.lcc.net ca-GrQc_Scores.txt 0.01 0.1
		To run RAND2:
			From the executable directory, the following command is used for execution:-
				format: ./ApproxKit 4 <graph_input_path> <scores_output_path> <number_of_nodes> 0
				e.g.  : ./ApproxKit 4 ca-GrQc.lcc.net ca-GrQc_Scores.txt 900 0
